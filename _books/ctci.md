*Cracking the Coding Interview* is the go-to resource for software engineers preparing for technical interviews, especially at top-tier tech companies like Google, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. Authored by former Google software engineer and interviewer Gayle Laakmann McDowell, this book offers not only 189 programming questions but also detailed solutions and explanations behind the problem-solving approaches.

What makes this book stand out is its balance between **theory and practice**—you don't just learn how to solve problems, you learn how to think like an interviewer. It also includes insights into behavioral interviews, resume tips, and the hiring processes at major tech firms.

This edition also expands on system design questions, object-oriented design, and scalability—critical areas for senior-level roles and FAANG interviews.

If you're serious about passing technical interviews and want to back your skills with solid problem-solving patterns, this book is a must-read.

Highly recommended as both a prep guide and a long-term reference for software engineers.
