*The Hundred-Page Language Models Book* by Andriy Burkov follows the same concise yet comprehensive approach as his machine learning book, but focuses specifically on large language models (LLMs).

In this timely work, Burkov distills the complex world of language models into an accessible format, covering everything from the fundamentals of transformer architecture to the latest developments in the field. What sets this book apart is its ability to explain sophisticated concepts like attention mechanisms, tokenization, and prompt engineering in clear, intuitive language.

The book provides a solid foundation for understanding how LLMs work, their capabilities and limitations, and practical considerations for implementing them in real-world applications. It's particularly valuable for software engineers and data scientists who need to quickly get up to speed with this rapidly evolving field.

With the AI landscape changing so rapidly, this book serves as an excellent primer for anyone looking to understand the current state of language models and their applications. It's a must-read for anyone working with or interested in AI technology.
