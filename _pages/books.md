## Books that I am reading, have read, or will read

I decided recently to flip the [Dunning Kruger Effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) and started a antilibrary, for those who are new to the term is it is a term that Nassim Nocholas Taleb mention as "the collection of unread books". I always hated the idea to store books, and have a ego-boosting library.
